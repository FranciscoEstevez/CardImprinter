# CardImprinter
Q&D asset baker for gamedev project using Android's layout framework because I don't know better.

Huge imprinter class and general code ugliness acknowledged. Including the UI block.

Sizes in pixels are actually intended to achieve correct outputs.

===============================

Lots of unlicensed assets and bad paint.net in /res/ and /assets/
